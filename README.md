# Hand_Detector_Using_Raspberry_Pi_3

In this repo there is one file which is a python file (video.py) for Hand Detection using OpenCV. There is no need for installing mediapipe for this particular code. Only OpenCV and cvzone can handle all the task including finger landmark detection and Boundary box. 

Also, for running this code it is necessary to have a Raspi Cam or any USB Camera for capturing hand pose. Otherwise, thius code can also work for Laptop and Desktop(having camera) if you remove all the Raspberry Pi codes.

**NOTE :** Use proper power supply otherwise there may be low fps problems. Currently this paticular code captures 5fps from the Raspi Camera.

Any suggestions to increase the fps of the raspberry pi cam will be appreciated.
